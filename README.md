As of 6/5/2020:
my_ex1.py is the my first attempt at making my own manim scenes. To run, put my_ex1.py in the same folder as manim.

There are 2 methods so far in my_ex1.py, both of which working with the transformation of different shapes. circle_to_square
transforms a circle into a square, and tri_circ_sqaure shows a trianlge turn into a circle and then a square. To show these, use
the following cmd commands.
For circle_to_square: python manim.py my_ex1.py circle_to_square -pl
For tri_circ_square: python manim.py my_ex1.py tri_circ_square  -pl


As of 6/12/2020:
my_ex2.py is the second go at making manim scenes. To run, put my_ex2.py in the same folder as manim.

There are 2 methods in my_ex2.py, both are working with different text transitions and making the animations look smoother. To run these on the Command Prompt, do as follows:
For text: python manim.py my_ex2.py text
For text_and_shapes: python manim.py my_ex2.py text_and_shapes
