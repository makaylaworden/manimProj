# This is my first attempt to make my own manim scene,
# it follows closely with what is done in example_scene.py (from git),
# along with Manim tutorial 1.1 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI2YJff9SgI)

# To run this code, make sure it is in the same folder as manim.py and
# follow the commands given above each method.
